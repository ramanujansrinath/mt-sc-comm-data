# Attention improves information flow between neuronal populations without changing the communication subspace
This is a repository for public access of data and matlab code to generate the figures from Srinath et al, 2021. For any further requests or clarifications, please contact the corresponding author.

## Data
Processed data is under data/randSplitsOnline_20 and data/randSplitsOnline_1000. These were processed with 20 or 1000 random splits of the MT and SC populations. The raw data files are too bulky for github. We will be processing them through the [NeuroData Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org) pipeline and uploading them to [OSF](https://osf.io)._Note: These are not the same population splits that were used to generate the figures for the manuscript._

## Figure generation
The script mainSc_randSplits has sections that generate all panels of figures 4 and 6 (including all panels of the corresponding supplementary figures). It also generates some additional plots that might be of interest. Data and code for figure 5 and 7 will be uploaded shortly.
