# Attention improves information flow between neuronal populations without changing the communication subspace
This is a repository for public access of data and matlab code to generate the figures from Srinath et al, 2021. For any further requests or clarifications, please contact the corresponding author.

## Data
Processed data is under data/randSplitsOnline_20 and data/randSplitsOnline_1000. These were processed with 20 or 1000 random splits of the MT and SC populations. _Note: These are not the same population splits that were used to generate the figures for the manuscript._ The raw data files are too bulky for github. Please [email me](ramsrinath@uchicago.edu) for access.

## Figure generation
The script mainSc_randSplits has sections that generate all panels of figures 4 and 6 (including all panels of the corresponding supplementary figures). It also generates some additional plots that might be of interest.
